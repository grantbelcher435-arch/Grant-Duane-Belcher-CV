## Executive Q&A Portfolio

**Q: What makes your leadership style unique?**  
**A:** My hallmark is channel sales strategic leadership—treating partners as a true extension of the sales force. I balance direct and indirect sales, unlocking scalable revenue streams and transforming GTM execution across banking, insurance, SaaS, and more.

**Q: How do you drive innovation and exceed revenue targets?**  
**A:** I architect indirect sales models where VARs and resellers generate new business at scale. At Baker Street, our partner-driven approach expanded SaaS adoption across Africa and doubled market share. I align channel strategy with C-suite KPIs, consistently securing multi-million-dollar deals.

**Q: What digital and automation projects set you apart?**  
**A:**  
- **Automated Competitor Price Tracking:** Dynamic pricing for market leadership in e-commerce.  
- **Order & Inventory Dashboards:** Real-time, multi-supplier visibility for operational efficiency.  
- **AI Product Descriptions:** SEO-optimized, conversion-focused copy at scale.  
- **Customer Support Bots:** 24/7 customer engagement, reduced workload.  
- **YouTube Automation:** AI-driven scriptwriting, idea generation, analytics, and auto-posting—driving inbound leads and reach.  
- **Cross-Platform Social Automation:** Launch amplification, omnichannel engagement, and MQL generation.

**Q: How do you enable partners and teams?**  
**A:** By sharing analytics, enablement, and custom GTM tools, I empower both internal sales and partner networks to outperform. I’m a mentor and a multiplier—building revenue engines, not just sales teams.

**Q: Why should headhunters and execs connect with you?**  
**A:** I thrive in roles with ambitious KPIs, high-growth mandates, and the need for innovative GTM. My channel-first approach delivers against revenue and operational quotas, making me an ideal candidate for strategic, high-value roles.
